we originally worked with the nasflask v1, but soon found it did not work well.

DOing web requests with the arduino native environment was not ideal.

The solution we later found in v2 was that the webhook method worked well.

I built the webhook credentials into ISS.json and me.json.

Me.json was the crecdentials for the IP address gps location API
meanwhile, the ISS.json was the credentials for the ISS api.

Just wanted to make sure you knew what you were looking at.


Cheers!
